# CFD

CFD Tasks included currently in this repository:

(A)  For the advection equation, discretise and implement an upwind first order semi-Langrangian scheme and with a periodic boundary condition.

ADD ADVECTION EQUATION
DOMAIN
INITIAL CONDITIONS
LAMBDA VALUES FROM 0.5 TO 5.0
ALPHA 0.5
t=1s

(B) Add a new equation in the system by making propagation velocity non-constant and time-varying obeying the below:

SAME CONDITIONS AS ABOVE
SPECIFY THE VELOCITY EQUATION
DELTA-T = 0.1
SAME INITIAL CONDITIONS
VARYING GRIDPOINTS
